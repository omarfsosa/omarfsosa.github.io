I'm yet another jaded theoretical physiscist that sold his soul to the data science industry in exchange for a stable mental heatlh.

I started working at Faculty on January 2019, after having done a short project for Rolls Royce Motor Cars as part of the _Faculty Fellowship XII_. You can see my final presentation on [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjV2XPZj4JA&t=100s). The kind of work I enjoy doing is closer to statistics than to deep learning stuff. But saying I do statistics tends to be such a mood killer that I prefer to call myself a Data Scientist. If I'm feeling wild, sometimes I'll even say I do _A. I._.

Before my current role, I did a PhD at Durham University in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, where I was doing research on the AdS/CFT correspondence. If you happen to be interested in those sort of things, my InspireHEP profile with list of publications is [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1487680). Even before that, I did the masters programme at Imperial College called _Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces_. And even before that I did a physics undergrad in Mexico (BUAP).

A quick summary of my interests:
- Statistics -- I love my job. Sue me.
- Mathematics: Group theory and geometry are my favourite areas of mathematics.
- Literature. Ever since I read _Fictions_ by Jorge Luis Borges, it is the only fiction book I enjoy reading.
- Music. I play acoustic guitar since I was 15. My favourite band are the Foo Fighters.
- Videogames. Of course I love videogames. I'm a PS4 guy. I can't wait to be a PS5 guy.
- Photography. I really just got started here. Hopefully I'll post some photos here soon.
- Cycling. I recently got into cycling and it's so much fun. I wish I started before.
- Muay Thai. I practiced it for several years but now it's been a while since I don't.
