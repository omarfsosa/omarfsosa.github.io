Hello! 

I'm Omar, a theoretical physicist that now does data science for a living. Since 2018, I've been living in London, working for a data science consultancy called Faculty. The kind of work I do focuses mostly on Bayesian inference.

Before my current role, I did a PhD at Durham University in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, where I was doing research on the AdS/CFT correspondence. If you happen to be interested in those sort of things, my InspireHEP profile with list of publications is [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1487680). Even before that, I did the masters programme at Imperial College called _Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces_. And even before that I did a physics undergrad in Mexico (BUAP).

###  Why Spicy Research?

Because:
1. It is a reasearch blog,
2. I'm Mexican and love spicy food,
3. I have zero creativity,
4. I don't take my writing too seriously, and neither should you.
